# Donut's Simple React

Welcome! This repo contains some simple tutorials and examples that will hopefully be helpful in learning React. These materials are going to cover:

- Building a simple app using React and Typescript
- Using state hooks to hold component state
- Using effect hooks to tie into external data sources and libraries

This should hopefully be enough to get you started on making your own apps!

The format of this tutorial will be a series of pre started apps, using create-react-app to take care of the overhead of compiling and running the app. Each app folder will be in the begining state for the tutorial that lives with it (Start with the README). If you follow the tutorial instructions, you should transform the app in that folder into the finished product, which will be the next tutorial folder :)

For example, start with the `getting-started` folder, which contains a bare create-react-app app with nothing done to it, and some instructions in it's README. If you follow thoes instructions, you should end up with an app that is at least pretty similar to the one located in `hooks`, which is the next step.

Sound good?
